# 🛠️ Hibernate Learning Project

This is a **Java-based Hibernate project** designed for learning purposes. It uses **Scanner** for user input and demonstrates key features of Hibernate ORM including:

- ✅ Basic Hibernate setup and configuration
- ✅ CRUD operations
- ✅ One-to-One mapping
- ✅ One-to-Many & Many-to-One mapping
- ✅ Parameterized and non-parameterized constructors
- ✅ Return type and void methods
- ✅ Local and global variables
- ✅ Real-world style entities and relationships

- Hibernate configuration using `hibernate.cfg.xml`
- Entity classes with annotations (`@Entity`, `@Id`, `@OneToOne`, `@OneToMany`, etc.)
- Session and transaction handling
- Performing basic CRUD operations using Hibernate
- Using Scanner to take runtime input from users
- Working with parameterized methods and return types
- Creating relationships between tables (One-to-One, One-to-Many)
